In order to run my svelte app, I can either type "npm run dev" to start a development server, or "npm start" to start a production server.  However I will need to run "npm run build" to build the app before running it with "npm start" (but not when I want to run with "npm run dev").
Use "docker build -t <docker-image-name> <path-to-docker-file>" to build a docker image, then use "docker run <docker-image-name>" to run a container using that docker image.  When running a container on my local machine for testing purposes, use "docker run -p <localhost-port-to-forward-to>:<container-port-to-forward> <docker-image-name>".
